/* An abstract class is a class that is declared abstractâ€” it may or may not include abstract methods. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed. An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation (without braces, and followed by a semicolon), 

like this: 

	abstract void moveTo(double deltaX, double deltaY); 
	
If a class includes abstract methods, then the class itself must be declared abstract,
a class extends abstract class, but implements interface    

Abstraction is one of the key concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. Its main goal is to handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user
