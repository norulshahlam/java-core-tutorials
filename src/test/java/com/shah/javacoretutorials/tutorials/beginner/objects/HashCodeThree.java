hashCode() vs .equals()

A hash code is an integer that is derived from an object. Hash codes should be scrambledâ€”if x and y are two distinct objects, there should be a high probability that 
x.hashCode() and y.hashCode() are different

Importance of equals() and hashCode() method

The implementation of equals() and hashCode() should follow these rules.

If o1.equals(o2), then o1.hashCode() == o2.hashCode() should always be true.
If o1.hashCode() == o2.hashCode is true, it does not mean that o1.equals(o2) will be true.
