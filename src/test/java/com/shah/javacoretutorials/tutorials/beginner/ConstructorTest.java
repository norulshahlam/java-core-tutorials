What is constructor???

A constructor in Java is a special method used to initialize objects.
The constructor is called when an object of a class is created.

It can be used to set initial values for object attributes:
1. We show how constructor works
2. What is default constructor and
3. What is parameterized constructor (constructor overloading)
4. Diff types of param cons by number of arguments, args datatype, order of args

When do we need ConstructorTest Overloading?

Sometimes there is a need of initializing an object in different ways.
This can be done using constructor overloading.
For example, Thread class has 8 types of constructors.
If we do not want to specify anything about a thread, then we can simply use the default constructor of Thread class

******************************************

A.
This demonstrates that if you create an object with constructor,
it will call the method by default whether it is defaulted or parameterized.

B.
All classes have constructors by default: if you do not create a class constructor yourself, Java creates one for you.

C.
Constructors are used to initialize the objectâ€™s state.
Constructors are used to assign values to the class variables at the time of object creation,
either explicitly done by the programmer or by Java itself
(default constructor).

D.
However, then you are not able to set initial values for object attributes.

1. constructor has the same name as class name
2. Doesn't return anything (void)
3. ConstructorTest will be called once you create the object

         So if you define something in the constructor like a print statement, it will print by itself.
