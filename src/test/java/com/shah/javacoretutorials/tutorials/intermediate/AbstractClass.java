/* Abstraction is one of the key concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. Its main goal is to handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user. An abstract class is a class declared abstractâ€” it may or may not include abstract methods. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed. An abstract method is a method declared without an implementation (without braces, and followed by a semicolon).

Like this:

	Abstract void moveTo(double deltaX, double deltaY);

If a class includes abstract methods, then the class itself must be declared abstract. Even if one method is abstract, then the class must be declared abstract

A class extends abstract class, but implements interface

    /* if a method is concrete(not abstract) then a body is needed. else error. */
    void gender() {
        System.out.println("male, female");
