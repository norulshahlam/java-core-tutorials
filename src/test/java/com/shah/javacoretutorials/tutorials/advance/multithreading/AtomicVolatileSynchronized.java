Synchronized
For executing on Methods/blocks
Can be used to implement lock-based algorithms
Slow because of acquire and release of lock
No possibility of deadlock and livelock

Volatile
For read / write variables
Can be used to implement Non-lock-based algorithms
Relatively faster than Synchronized
Possibility of deadlock and livelock

Atomic
For read / write / modify variables
Can be used to implement Non-lock-based algorithms
Relatively faster than Synchronized and Volatile
Possibility of deadlock and livelock
